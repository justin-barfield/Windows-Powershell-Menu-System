# Windows-Powershell-Menu-System
This is a menu based system created with the purpose to assist IT support technicians more efficiently perform daily tasks. It would also act as a central source of information to assit new technicians ease into the position.

This project was not assigned by management but was something I thought necessary. The original idea was to create everything in CMD but was eventially revised to use Windows PowerShell due to its increased functionality.

Use of CMD and PowerShell was limited to one-off commands before beginning this project. Reading through the code will show how my understanding of CMD and PowerShell evolved as the scripting continued. This project began in January 2020 and was abandoned March 2020 due to Covid-19 and other contributing factors. 

Included in the code are the following:
- Text based menu system
- Configuration for loaner computer
- Configuration for standard computers
- Individual application installations
- Check-in scripting and embedding for loaners
- Loaner cleanup
- etc.
